I developed this project to experiment with neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.

The GUI displays a text area with information, and a graphical representation of the fittest network from each generation.

A graph at the bottom left shows species and their size over time.

Buttons at the right allow the user to navigate across generations and reset the evolution.

Dependencies (They can be installed using PIP):

Kivy		1.11.1
kivy-deps.sdl2	0.4.2
kivy-deps.glew	0.3.0
